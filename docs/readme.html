<h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Bean Builder is a simple builder that demonstrates the new persistance 
  mechanism. The new persistance scheme is a text based mechanism that allows 
  for the long term storage and reconstruction of Java Bean object graphs. </p>
<p>Bean Builder is also a demonstration of the following technologies: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Design time meta information specified in javadoc format and generated as 
    name-value pairs in BeanInfo classes. </li>
  <li>Dynamic adapter generation to hook up events using the new JDK 1.3 Proxy 
    API's. See <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/guide/reflection/proxy.html" target="_blank">Dynamic 
    Proxy Classes</a> for details. </li>
  <li>New JFC/Swing based Property Editors for editing: Fonts, Colors, Objects, 
    Dimension, Insets, Rectangles, etc,... </li>
  <li>Actions architecture based on javax.swing.Action interface. See <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/guide/swing/ActionsChanges.html" target="_blank">Adding 
    Actions to ActionEvent Sources</a> for details. </li>
  <li>A simple Jar classloader based on <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/java/net/URLClassLoader.html" target="_blank">java.net.URLClassLoader</a> 
    that was introduced in JDK 1.2 </li>
  <li>Correct use of JFC/Swing TableModels and TreeModels. </li>
  <li>Sorting and filtering using the Java collections classes introduced in JDK 
    1.2</li>
</ul>
<p>Watch <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc" target="_blank">The Swing 
  Connection</a> for upcoming articles about how Bean Builder implements these technologies. 
</p>
<h2><a name="sys"></a>System Requirements</h2>
<p>The Bean Builder requires JDK 1.3 beta or later to be installed in order to run. </p>
<p>You can get an early access of the JDK 1.3 from the <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/" target="_blank">Java 
  Developer Connection</a>. </p>
<blockquote>

  </p>

<p>You will need to register if you are not already a member of the JDC. Registration 
  is free. </p>
<h2><a name="install"></a>Installation</h2>
<p>To install Bean Builder, </p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new directory for the installation. This will be refered to as 
    the &quot;root distribution directory&quot;.</li>
  <li>Unzip the beanbox.zip file in the root distribution directory preserving 
    the directory structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>The guide directory contains the User Guide and the Tutorial for the Bean Builder.</p>
<h2><a name="run"></a>Running Bean Builder </h2>
<p>Make sure that you have access to a local distribution of JDK 1.3 beta or later. 
  You <i>must</i> use a JDK 1.3 beta or later since the archiver and event adapter 
  generation requires API that was introduced in 1.3 </p>
<ol>
  <li>Download the distribution file <i>beanbox.zip.</i></li>
  <li>Unpack the archive preserving directories.</li>
  <li>Run the <b>&quot;runnit [ jdk1.3 root path] &quot;</b> script file. </li>
</ol>
<p>The <b>runnit</b> script takes a single argument which is the root to the JDK 
  1.3 distribution. If the root is not specified then default values are used. 
</p>
<p>For Solaris, the shell script is called <b>runnit</b> and the default root 
  used is <b>/usr/local/java/jdk1.3/solaris.</b> </p>
<p>For the PC, the batch file is called <b>runnit.bat</b> and the default root 
  is assumed to be <b>c:\jdk1.3</b>.</p>
<h2><a name="notes"></a>Application Notes</h2>
<p>An instance of JPanel is the root of the object hierarchy. This JPanel is using 
  absolute positioning as it's layout manager. </p>
<p>The builder was not designed for building a menu tree. All behavior associated 
  with components on the &quot;Menu&quot; tab is unsupported. A newer release 
  may address this.</p>
<p>Creating instances of components from the &quot;Containers&quot; tab is undefined 
  with the exception of JScrollPane. </p>
<p>You can drop a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/javax/swing/Scrollable.html" target="_blank">Scrollable</a> 
  component such as JList, JTable and JTree in a JScrollPane and the component 
  will be added correctly to the JScrollPane container delegate. However, The 
  Scrollable component will be inaccessible for creating interactions with other 
  components in the design panel.</p>
<p>The selected bounds of a Scrollable components in a JScrollPane will display 
  the resizing handles relative to the parent JScrollPane rather than the Design 
  Panel. This is a known bug.</p>
<p>Editing a text field PropertyEditor could cause an exception if the value is 
  not commited. Pressing the enter key after entering a new value will set that 
  property on the bean. If the value has not been commited then an exception may 
  occur when the property panel is loaded with properties from another object. 
  This is a known bug.</p>
<p>The Swing BeanInfo classes in dt.jar for JDK 1.3 Beta does not have a complete 
  set of information. Specifically, the short descriptions for the components 
  are not complete and some icons may be missing. This omissions don't affect 
  the functionality of the builder and will be fixed with JDK 1.3. </p>
<p>There is no separation between a design representation and the actual application 
  being designed. The archive created will reflect the actual state of the application 
  at the time it was archived. This means that if the app is tested and runtime 
  properties are changed an archive snapshot will represent the current state.</p>
