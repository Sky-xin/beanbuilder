<h1 align="center"> Tutorial for Bean Builder</h1>
<h4 align="center">by Mark Davidson</h4>
<hr>
<p>This tutorial will demonstrate the main features of building an application 
  with Bean Builder. It will cover, component instantiation, property editing, 
  property association and event adapter creation for wiring events. You will 
  also save the design and run it outside Bean Builder.</p>
<p>Please skim over the <a href="userguide.html">User's Guide</a> so that you 
  will be familiar with the various areas of the Bean Builder user interface.</p>
<h3>The Application</h3>
<p>The simple application that will be built is an entry list. Pressing return 
  on a text field will appends it's contents as a list item. A button will be 
  enabled to remove all the items from the list. </p>
<p>The application will be developed by laying out the components, wiring them 
  together and saving the design to disk. </p>
<h3>1. Create the Design</h3>
<p>Objects are retrieved from the Object Palette below the toolbar. As you move 
  your cursor over the individual items, notice that a brief description of that 
  object is presented in the status bar.</p>
<p>If you hold you're cursor over the object icon, a tooltip will appear with 
  the type of object. You can change the icons in the palette using the <i>Icons</i> 
  menu. The icons, tooltip text, and status string has been retrieved from the 
  <i>BeanInfo</i> class associated with the object class. </p>
<p><i>Note: The BeanInfo information is incomplete for JDK 1.3 beta.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Select the <i>JList</i> item from the Swing tab on the objects palette. 
  </b></p>
<p>Notice that the cursor changes from a pointer to a cross hair. This indicates 
  that the tool is in &quot;instantiation mode&quot;. </p>
<p><b>Click and drag a small rectangle onto the design panel. </b></p>
<p>An empty <i>JList</i> should appear and the cursor will return to a pointer.</p>
<p>Repeat the process for a <i>JTextField,</i> <i>JLabel</i> and a <i>JButton</i> 
  so that the interface looks the same as the following figure:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ui_design.jpg" width="197" height="226" border="2" alt="UI Design"></p>
<p>Clicking on an object will make it the <i>current object</i>. The properties 
  of the current object will be displayed in the properties panel. If this is 
  a visual object, then it will be selected in the <a href="userguide.html">Containment 
  Hierarchy</a>. The current object will have blue resizing handles around it. 
  These handles can be used to resize and move the object.</p>
<h3>2. Setting Object Properties</h3>
<p>The Property Panel contains a list of introspected properties of the current 
  object. Each row represents a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyDescriptor.html">PropertyDescriptor</a> 
  and the array of descriptors in encapsulated in the <i>beanbox.property.PropertyTableModel</i>. 
</p>
<p>The <b>Property</b> column shows the display name of the <i>PropertyDescriptor</i> 
  in alphabetical order. If you hold the mouse over an item in this column, a 
  tooltip appears with the short description of the property from the <i>PropertyDescriptor</i>.</p>
<p>The <b>Value</b> column displays the current value for that property in a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditor.html" target="_blank">PropertyEditor</a> 
  that was specified for that type.</p>
<p><b>Select the JButton object as the current object and change the <i>label</i> 
  property to &quot;Remove All&quot;.</b> </p>
<p>When you press the Enter key, the text of the button should be changed to the 
  new property value.</p>
<p><b>Change the name of the JLabel object to &quot;Add: &quot; by changing it's 
  <i>text</i> property</b> </p>
<p><b>Increase the value of the JLabel object's<i> font</i> property to 18 point 
  using the font PropertyEditor.</b> </p>
<p><b>Finally, set the <i>horizontalAlignment</i> of the label to be right justified 
  by selecting &quot;RIGHT&quot; using the alignment combo box.</b></p>
<p>Your user interface should look like the following:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="ui_properties.jpg" width="189" height="221" border="2"></p>
<h3 align="left">3. Creating a Non-Visual Bean</h3>
<p align="left">The model view controller (MVC) architecture of the JFC components 
  requires a model which acts as an intermediary between the user interaction 
  and the data. In order to have list display data a model should be associated 
  with it. For this example, we are going to set the model of the JList object 
  to use a <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/javax/swing/DefaultListModel.html" target="_blank">DefaultListModel</a>. 
  First we have to create a new instance of the list model and place it on the 
  design panel for manipulation.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Put the cursor focus in the <i>Instantiate Bean</i> text field 
  (try alt-b) and enter the following string: <i>javax.swing.DefaultListModel</i></b></p>
<p align="left">A rectangle in the upper left of the design panel should appear 
  and it will be the selected object. Notice that the Containment Hierarchy doesn't 
  show the same selection. This is because the hierarchy only displays visual 
  beans and the list model is non-visual (i.e., not subclassed from java.awt.Component).</p>
<h3 align="left">4. Setting an Object as a Property of Another Object</h3>
<p align="left">The newly instantiated DefaultListModel is in the design but is 
  not associated with an object. This model should be associated with the JList 
  object in the user interface. Use the <i>Interaction Wizard</i> to define the 
  way that objects relate to eachother. The interaction will be to take a source 
  object and set it as a property value on the target object using a setter method 
  from the target. This means that we want to call the JList.setModel(...) method 
  with the list model as the argument.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Click on the instance of the DefaultListModel and drag the 
  mouse over to the JList object.</b></p>
<p align="left">Notice that a line is drawn between the list model and the JList 
  object. The JList is highlighted as a suitable target. When the mouse is released, 
  the Interaction Wizard appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img src="wizard_prop.jpg" width="558" height="320"></p>
<p align="left">The items in the list will be target object methods whose parameter 
  matches the type of the source object or can be related by an <i>isAssignableFrom</i> 
  inheritance relationship.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Select the &quot;model( ListModel )&quot; list item and select 
  the <i>Finish</i> button.</b></p>
<p align="left">The Interaction Wizard will be dismissed and the DefaultListModel 
  instance will be used as the model for the JList object. You can verify this 
  by selecting the JList object and looking at the model property in the Property 
  Panel.</p>
<h3 align="left"><b>5. Creating Event Adapters</b></h3>
<p align="left">The traditional way of creating an event interaction between two 
  objects was to create a small inner class and recompile it.</p>
<p align="left">This builder uses the new &quot;java.lang.reflect.Proxy&quot; 
  API to create &quot;trampoline&quot; objects as event listeners. This API was 
  added to JDK 1.3 and are used to synthesize listeners of arbitrary types at 
  runtime. The advantage of using this methodology is that it avoids costly inner 
  classes and you can dynamically create these listener classes without having 
  to recompile code.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Click on the JTextField object and drag the cursor to the DefaultListModel 
  object.</b></p>
<p align="left">The Interaction Wizard will appear. The default mode will be to 
  create a property association. Select the <i>Event Adapter</i> radio button 
  and the Wizard will reconfigure itself for generating an event adapter. Notice 
  that the <i>Finish</i> button is disabled and the <i>Next</i> button is enabled. 
  This indicates that there are more steps to create the adapter.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="wizard_evt1.jpg" width="614" height="394"></p>
<p align="left"><b>Select the &quot;action&quot; item in the &quot;Event Sets&quot; 
  list and select the <i>Next</i> button</b></p>
<p align="left">You will be presented with the next page of the wizard that will 
  allow the selection of a target method on the DefaultListModel instance. As 
  a simplification, only target methods that require one or zero arguments are 
  listed. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="wizard_evt2.jpg" width="614" height="394"></p>
<p align="left"><b>Select the &quot;addElement( Object )&quot; item in the &quot;Target 
  Methods&quot; list and select the <i>Next</i> button</b></p>
<p align="left">If the target method has arguments, then the next page will allow 
  for the setting of the arguments.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="wizard_evt3.jpg" width="614" height="394"></p>
<p align="left">The top portion of the panel will be a list of type value pairs 
  for the defining the arguments statically. The value column will load the PropertyEditor 
  associated with the type from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.3/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditorManager.html" target="_blank">PropertyEditorManager</a>. 
</p>
<p align="left">The lower portion of the panel is a list of no argument methods 
  retrieved from the source object that return the same type that the target method 
  requires as an argument. This will allow for adapters that get generated which 
  use <code>target.setFoo(source.getBar);</code></p>
<p align="left"><b>Select the &quot;getText( )&quot; item in the &quot;Source 
  Methods&quot; list and select the <i>Finish</i> button.</b></p>
<p align="left">A new interaction handler will be created that will add the string 
  in the JTextField to the list when the Enter key is pressed.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Create a new event adapter for the JButton using the Interaction 
  Wizard. </b></p>
<p align="left">The interaction will delete all the items in the list when the 
  &quot;Remove All&quot; button is pressed. Repeat the same steps through the 
  wizard. Using the following values:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Source Object:</b> JButton</li>
  <li><b>Target Object:</b> DefaultListModel</li>
  <li><b>Source Method:</b> actionPerformed( ActionEvent )</li>
  <li><b>Target Method:</b> removeAllElements( )</li>
</ul>
<h3 align="left">6. Testing the Design</h3>
<p align="left">The adapters and property association are set and created for 
  &quot;live&quot; objects. Test the design by taking the tool out the &quot;Design 
  Mode&quot; and putting it into &quot;Runtime Mode&quot;. You can switch between 
  these two states by selecting or deselecting the &quot;Design Mode&quot; checkbox 
  (alt-d). This Action is mirrored on the View menu.</p>
<p align="left">In Runtime mode, the objects on the design panel become &quot;live&quot;. 
  The application behaves the way that it was designed.</p>
<p align="left">Type some values in the text field an press the Enter key at end 
  of each string. These values should appear in the list. Pressing the &quot;Remove 
  All&quot; button will clear the list.</p>
<h3 align="left">7. Saving the Design</h3>
<p align="left">Bean Builder uses a new method of persistence that can write the object 
  graph and properties out to disk in a plain (and editable) text format. There 
  are two new formats available: BeanScript - a terse format that is similar in 
  syntax to an expression evaluator language and XML format.</p>
<p align="left">Press the <i>Save</i> button to save the design to disk. If this 
  is the first time that the design is saved, then you will be prompted with a 
  FileChooserDialog to select the format and the name of the persistence file.</p>
<p align="left"><i>Note: The data currently in the models and text fields will 
  also be saved to disk. If you wish to save the application in a blank state 
  then delete all the values.</i></p>
<p align="left">If you saved the design in an XML format then you should have 
  a file that looks like this: <a href="test.xml">test.xml</a></p>
<p align="left">Use the <i>Open</i> button to reload the design or open an alternative 
  design.</p>
<p align="left">Use the <i>New</i> button to create a new design.</p>
<p align="left">All these buttons are mirrored in the <i>File</i> menu.</p>
<h3 align="left">8. Reading the Design in a Different Application</h3>
<p align="left">Part of the goals of Bean Builder is to introduce a new portable persistence 
  format. Included is a modest 50 line program called TestShell that reads a design 
  persistence file and recreate it. </p>
<p align="left">From the root of the directory, enter the string on a command 
  line from the root of the distribution:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><code>% java -cp beanbox.jar TestShell test.xml</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">The panel that was was created with the builder should be in a 
  frame.</p>
